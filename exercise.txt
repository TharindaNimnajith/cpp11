1) Create your own implementations of unique pointer and shared pointer.
   Study the std unique and std shared pointer implementations.
   Create your own implementation of shared pointer and unique pointer.
   Make sure to have separate set of files for  each implementation.
   Add unit tests for each implementation and make sure at lease 90% of scenarios are covered.
   Use of C++11 or above features are preferred.

2) Implement a class/code segment to depict std::move usage with std::string and illustrate a
   scenario when the std::move is not effective in strings and explain the reason.
